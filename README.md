Tenant Safety Inspection Report
446 Hospital Street
Steinbach, MB
CANADA

June 25, 2025

Produced by Brad Taylor

This document outlines a series of critical safety, building code, and housing standard violations observed at the above address, which was rented to my household by Century 21 of Steinbach, MB (32 Brandt St #101, Steinbach, MB R5G 0T4).  The findings presented here are supported by photographic evidence, code references from the Canadian Electrical Code (CEC), Manitoba Plumbing Code (MPC), and the Manitoba Building Code (MBC), as well as applicable standards enforced under The Residential Tenancies Act and The Public Health Act.

The unit was leased to us two years ago by a Century 21 representative who, as of this writing, no longer works at the company. In light of the scale and severity of the violations, it is strongly suspected that the property may have been leased with deliberate disregard for tenant safety, or worse—with intent to cause harm through unsafe living conditions. This suggests that current staff at Century 21 Steinbach may be unaware that this property was rented out under false pretenses or fraudulent circumstances by a now-departed employee.

Each entry in this report is listed in order from least to most severe, allowing inspectors, adjudicators, and municipal officers to review the scope of hazards in escalating seriousness. Many of these violations represent risks to personal safety, building integrity, and property, reflecting an overall pattern of gross negligence, unsafe construction practices, and unfit habitation.

This document is intended for submission to the following authorities:
    • City of Steinbach Planning & Building Inspections
    • Manitoba Public Health – Environmental Health Services
    • Residential Tenancies Branch (RTB)
    • And any other agencies or representatives assigned to investigate the safety and legality of rental accommodations.

🧰🚽 Violation #1:  Floating Horizontal PVC Pipe
    • A horizontal PVC pipe, 32 inches long
    • Attached to what appears to be a sewer vent relief stack (which should be rigid and vertical)
    • Protruding unsupported into living space
    • 18 inches off the ground, i.e., right at ankle/shin level—prime tripping hazard
    • Entirely unsupported at the free end

(Figures 1a-c)

🚫 Code Violations Triggered
🔧 Manitoba Plumbing Code / NPC Rule 2.2.10.6 — Pipe Support Requirements
"All piping shall be adequately supported to prevent movement, vibration, and mechanical damage."
This floating PVC is 100% non-compliant.
A pipe connected to the vent or drain system cannot just hang in mid-air—especially not one that could:
    • Detach from the vent stack
    • Leak sewer gases into the home (if it's part of a DWV system)
    • Crack at the hub or elbow from weight
⚠️ Rule 2.4.6.2 — Vent Pipes Shall Be Rigid and Protected
Vent pipes must maintain alignment, not sag, and must not be installed in a way that allows movement or disconnection under normal household traffic.

🚧 Risk Assessment
While an unsupported PVC pipe is not as catastrophic as other violations, this hazard still creates:
    • Trip & fall risk (especially if lighting is poor)
    • Chance of joint failure
    • Potential gas leak from sewer


🔥Violation #2: Electrical Wiring Weaved to Plumbing Work

(Figures 2a-c)

🚫 Code Violations Triggered
🔌📏 CEC Rule 12-518 — Location of Conductors Relative to Pipes
"Conductors shall not be installed in contact with heating ducts, hot water or steam pipes, or other piping systems likely to cause damage to the insulation, unless suitable protection is provided."

🔌🧱 CEC Rule 12-514 — Wires Shall Not Support or Be Entangled With Other Systems
“Cables… shall not be used to support other objects.”
Even weaving wires between perpendicular plumbing runs puts strain and risk of movement/vibration, especially if plumbing shifts due to temperature or water hammer. This creates:
    • Chafing on insulation
    • Hidden electrocution risks
    • High fire hazard

🔌📐 CEC Rule 12-516 — Minimum Separation Required
"A minimum 25 mm (1 inch) separation must be maintained between electrical conductors and plumbing, unless separated by a physical barrier."


⚡ Violation #3: Electrical Wiring Supporting Duct Work
 
 (Figures 3a-b, 4a-c, 5a-c)

🚫 Code Violations Triggered
🔥⚡ CEC Rule 12-514 — Support of Conductors
"Cables and raceways shall be supported in such a manner that they will not be damaged, and shall not be used to support other objects."
✅ This rule is clear and direct:
    • Electrical wires must be supported properly (e.g., with staples, straps, hangers—not improvised).
    • You cannot hang other systems, such as ductwork, plumbing, or building materials, on electrical wiring.

🧱 CEC Rule 12-510 — Mechanical Protection
“Cables shall be protected against mechanical damage.”

🚧 Risk Assessment
Supporting a heavy or shifting HVAC duct using an electrical cable is a textbook example of mechanical stress that could:
    • Damage insulation
    • Cause arcing, overheating, or fire
    • Lead to failure over time

    
⚡ Violation #4: Pinched Electrical Wiring

(Figures 6a-c)

🚫 Code Violations Triggered
🔹 CEC Rule 12-510 — Protection from Physical Damage
"Where there is a possibility of mechanical injury to a cable or conductor, it shall be adequately protected against such injury."
Pinching wires between wooden structures or near copper plumbing is not “adequate protection”—it increases the chance of:
    • Abrasion of insulation
    • Arc faults or ground faults
    • Electrocution or fire if wire insulation fails near plumbing (especially copper, which is conductive)

🔹 CEC Rule 12-3000 to 12-3032 — Wiring Methods
The general principles in these sections say that:
    • Cables must be securely supported and not under strain or pinched.
    • Cables must not be routed in a way that can damage the sheath or insulation.
If a wire is wedged between wood framing and a duct or plumbing line, that's a code violation unless protected by a raceway or shielding.

🔹 CEC Rule 12-516 — Minimum Separation from Other Services
"Electrical conductors shall be separated by at least 25 mm (1 inch) from plumbing, gas lines, and other services unless properly protected or separated by a barrier."
Routing wires tightly against copper plumbing violates this rule unless:
    • There's mechanical protection, like conduit or grommets.
    • There’s a minimum spacing, and no pressure or contact that could damage insulation.

🔹 CEC Rule 2-100 — Responsibility of Compliance
This rule makes it clear that the owner or contractor is responsible for compliance, and authorities (like electrical inspectors) can order corrections or disconnection of power if unsafe conditions are found.


🛑 Violation #5: Plumbing Underneath Floating Entranceway

(Figures 7a-d)

🚫 Code Violations Triggered
🔨🚿🚧 Manitoba Building Code Part 9 - Housing and Small Buildings
    • All load-bearing structures must have continuous vertical support to footings or be properly cantilevered with engineered load paths.
    • NBC 9.23.10.1 & 9.23.10.4 – improper beam support & load transfer.
A plywood board is not a legal support for a primary exterior entry platform corner. This is textbook deficient construction.
🧨 Risk Assessment
Bolting active plumbing pipes under the weakest load point is not just irresponsible—it’s sabotage-level stupid.
This could:
    • Burst the pipes if the deck fails.
    • Cause flooding, water damage, mold, or sewage contamination.
    • Risk personal injury from collapse or slipping on water damage.


🔌 Violation #6: Floating Electrical Switch Panel

🚫 Code Violations Triggered
🔹 CEC Rule 12-3016 — Boxes and Fittings Shall Be Securely Fastened
“Boxes shall be securely fastened in place and supported independently of the conduit or cable connection.”
That switch box is not allowed to just float on the pole. If it spins, twists, or flexes, it:
    • Puts strain on the wires
    • Risks loose terminals, arcing, and shock hazard
    • Is an obvious fire hazard, especially in damp or cluttered basement conditions

 🔹 CEC Rule 12-3034 — Switches Must Be Mounted Securely and Accessibly
“A switch shall be mounted on a suitable support so as to be stable and accessible.”

🔍 Risk Profile:
    • Shock risk if it shorts
    • Trip hazard if the wall shifts and someone lunges to turn it off
    • Fire risk if the loose connections arc inside the box


🚱 Violation #7: Unprotected Water Service Line

(Figures 9a-c)

🚫 Code Violations Triggered
📉 Manitoba Plumbing Code & National Plumbing Code
🔧 Clause 2.2.10.17 — Protection of Water Service Pipes:
“Where water service pipes enter a building and are exposed above floor level, they shall be protected against physical damage.”
🔩 Clause 2.2.10.15 — Location and Accessibility
“Every water meter and control valve shall be installed in a location that is accessible and protected from mechanical damage.”

🚨 Risk Assessment
    • If that pipe is hit, it can:
        ◦ Shear off at the base where it enters the concrete.
        ◦ Release full city water pressure into your basement.
        ◦ Flood the unit within seconds—and the only shutoff is at the city main.
    • You’d need to:
        ◦ Call the city’s 24-hour emergency utility line
        ◦ Hope they can get a crew out before your home is underwater
This is an unacceptable tenant risk, and grounds for declaring the unit unsafe for occupancy under the Residential Tenancies Act sections 7 and 76, and the Public Health Act – Unsafe Living Conditions.


🔧 Violation #8: Long, Dangling Water Pipe Faucets

(Figure 10a-c)

 🚫 Code Violations Triggered
🔹 Manitoba Plumbing Code (based on NPC 2020 / CSA B149)
🔹 Rule 2.2.10.6 — Support of Piping:
“Every pipe shall be securely supported with appropriate hangers or supports at intervals that prevent sagging, strain, or joint failure.”
🔹 Rule 2.3.3.1 — Water Distribution Support:
Water distribution pipes shall be supported so they do not move when valves are operated.

💥 Risk Assessment
    • A jerk, twist, or trip could rip it out, causing pressurized water to spray, potentially flooding the unit.
    • The tennant could be blamed unless it's formally documented as a known landlord hazard.
    • If hot water is involved, there’s also a burn/scalding risk if it dislodges or fails.


🧱 Violation #9: Support Pillars Not Anchored to Ceiling Joists

(Figures 11a, 12a)

🚫 Code Violations Triggered
📘 Manitoba Building Code (NBC Reference):
Section 9.17 – Columns and Posts
"Columns and posts shall be installed in such a way that they cannot be displaced under normal use and shall be mechanically fastened to prevent lateral movement or dislocation."

🚨 Risk Assessment
    • Structural beam can slip completely off the support during vibration
    • Load-bearing weight becomes unbalanced → wall cracking, floor sag, or full collapse
    • If someone were to accidentally strike the pillar (e.g. moving a washer/dryer, carrying lumber), the entire structural load path would fail
    • This is the kind of issue that, if discovered by an inspector, leads to an immediate evacuation order


🧨 Violation #10: Jack Post Fastening Plate Striking Gas Line

(Figure 13a)

🚫 Code Violations Triggered
🔹 Natural Gas & Propane Installation Code (CSA B149.1)
“Gas piping shall be installed so that it is protected from physical damage, and shall not be used to support structures or be subjected to load or vibration stress.”

🔹 Manitoba Building Code / NBC 9.33 & 9.10
Combustible gas lines shall be protected from structural contact and must not be installed in a way that compromises building stability.
Structural supports shall not transmit compressive or shear force into utility infrastructure.
🔔Risk Assessment
🧱 Structural Instability:
    • The post isn’t anchored to the ceiling or beam
    • Over time, it drifted out of alignment
    • It is now relying on the gas pipe to stop it from drifting further
🔥 Gas Line Risk:
    • The gas line is:
        ◦ Slightly lower than the beam
        ◦ Not intended to bear any force
        ◦ Now a collision buffer for structural weight


✅ Conclusion and Formal Request
After comprehensive inspection and documentation, it is now clear that this property is not simply in disrepair — it was assembled in such a way that suggests deliberate disregard for safety, code, and human life.  The accumulation and interconnection of severe structural, electrical, plumbing, and gas-related violations are not random nor accidental.

The property appears to have been constructed — or extensively modified — with such systemic disregard for code that it raises the suspicion this home was either:
    • Repurposed illegally with no oversight, or
    • Engineered to fail slowly, putting tenants in escalating danger over time

Critical safety systems (such as structural supports, electrical circuits, and gas lines) have been installed in ways that directly interact with one another to amplify risk.  At least one structural post is now resting against a live gas line — an arrangement so dangerous that it defies any reasonable explanation beyond intentional malfeasance or extreme negligence.

Furthermore, it is deeply troubling that:
    • This unit was rented by a Century 21 representative who no longer works at the company
    • No follow-up inspection or disclosure was ever made
    • Multiple hazards were blatantly ignored beyond common sense by landlords

This property poses an imminent risk of structural collapse, gas rupture, electrical fire, and tenant injury or death.  The combination of these failures leads to the strong suspicion that this house is not simply non-compliant — it is a booby trap, passed between renters who were never given a full understanding of the risks.

This unit represents a systemic and life-threatening failure of landlord responsibility.  There is reason to believe the property was rented with deliberate concealment of major code violations.  As such, I am requesting immediate lease termination without penalty, a full investigation into past leasing agents, and a review of this unit's safety history across municipal records.

Sincerely,

Brad Taylor
